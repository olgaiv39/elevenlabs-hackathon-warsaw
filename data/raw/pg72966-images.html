<h3>
I
</h3>
<p>
Not many weeks ago, on a street corner
in the village of Pascoag, Rhode
Island, a tall heavily built, and
wholesome looking pedestrian furnished much
speculation by a singular lapse of behavior.
He had, it appears, been descending the hill
by the road from Chepachet; and encountering
the compact section, had turned to
his left into the main thoroughfare where
several modest business blocks convey a
touch of the urban.  At this point, without
visible provocation, he committed his astonishing
lapse; staring queerly for a second at
the tallest of the buildings, before him,
and then, with a series of terrified, hysterical
shrieks, breaking into a frantic run which
ended in a stumble and fall at the next
crossing.  Picked up and dusted off by ready
hands, he was found to be conscious,
organically unhurt, and evidently cured of his
sudden nervous attack.  He muttered some
shamefaced explanations involving a strain
he had undergone, and with downcast glance
turned back, up the Chepachet road,
trudging out of sight, without once looking
behind him.  It was a strange incident to
befall so large, robust, normal-featured,
and capable-looking a man, and the strangeness
was not lessened by the remarks of a
bystander who had recognized him as the
boarder of a well-known dairyman on the
outskirts of Chepachet.
</p>
<p>
He was, it developed, a New York
police-detective named Thomas F. Malone, now
on a long leave of absence under medical
treatment after some disproportionately
arduous work on a gruesome local case which
accident had made dramatic.  There had been
a collapse of several old brick buildings
during a raid in which he had shared, and
something about the wholesale loss of life,
both of prisoners and of his companions,
had peculiarly appalled him.  As a result,
he had acquired an acute and anomalous
horror of any buildings even remotely
suggesting the ones which had fallen in, so that
in the end mental specialists forbade him
the sight of such things for an indefinite
period.  A police surgeon with relatives in
Chepachet had put forward that quaint
hamlet of wooden Colonial houses as an ideal
spot for the psychological convalescence; and
thither the sufferer had gone, promising
never to venture among the brick-lined
streets of larger villages till duly advised by
the Woonsocket specialist with whom he
was put in touch.  This walk to Pascoag for
magazines had been a mistake, and the
patient had paid in fright, bruises, and
humiliation for his disobedience.
</p>
<p>
So much the gossips of Chepachet and
Pascoag knew; and so much, also, the most
learned specialists believed.  But Malone had
at first told the specialists much more,
ceasing only when he saw that utter incredulity
was his portion.  Thereafter he held his
peace, protesting not at all when it was
generally agreed that the collapse of certain
squalid brick houses in the Red Hook
section of Brooklyn, and the consequent death
of many brave officers, had unseated his
nervous equilibrium.  He had worked too
hard, all said, in trying to clean up those
nests of disorder and violence; certain
features were shocking enough, in all
conscience, and the unexpected tragedy was the
last straw.  This was a simple explanation
which everyone could understand, and
because Malone was not a simple person he
perceived that he had better let it suffice.
To hint to unimaginative people of a horror
beyond all human conception—a horror of
houses and blocks and cities leprous and
cancerous with evil dragged from elder
worlds—would be merely to invite a padded
cell instead of a restful rustication, and
Malone was a man of sense despite his
mysticism.  He had the Celt's far vision of
weird and hidden things, but the logician's
quick eye for the outwardly unconvincing;
an amalgam which had led him far afield in
the forty-two years of his life, and set him
in strange places for a Dublin University
man born in a Georgian villa near Phoenix
Park.
</p>
<p>
And now, as he reviewed the things
he had seen and felt and apprehended,
Malone was content to keep unshared the
secret of what could reduce a dauntless
fighter to a quivering neurotic; what could
make old brick slums and seas of dark,
subtle faces a thing of nightmare and
eldritch portent.  It would not be the first
time his sensations had been forced to bide
uninterpreted—for was not his very act of
plunging into the polyglot abyss of New
York's underworld a freak beyond sensible
explanation?  What could he tell the prosaic
of the antique witcheries and grotesque
marvels discernible to sensitive eyes amidst
the poison cauldron where all the varied
dregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom
and perpetuate their obscene terrors?  He
had seen the hellish green flame of secret
wonder in this blatant, evasive welter of
outward greed and inward blasphemy, and
had smiled gently when all the New Yorkers
he knew scoffed at his experiment in
police work.  They had been very witty and
cynical, deriding his fantastic pursuit of
unknowable mysteries and assuring him that
in these days New York held nothing but
cheapness and vulgarity.  One of them had
wagered him a heavy sum that he could
not—despite many poignant things to his credit
in the <i>Dublin Review</i>—even write a truly
interesting story of New York low life; and
now, looking back, he perceived that cosmic
irony had justified the prophet's words while
secretly confuting their flippant meaning.
The horror, as glimpsed at last, could not
make a story—for like the book cited by
Poe's German authority, "er lässt sich nicht
lesen"—it does not permit itself to be read.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<h3>

</h3>
<p>
To Malone the sense of latent
mystery in existence was always present.
In youth he had felt the hidden beauty and
ecstasy of things, and had been a poet; but
poverty and sorrow and exile had turned his
gaze in darker directions, and he had
thrilled at the imputations of evil in the
world around.  Daily life had for him come
to be a fantasmagoria of macabre shadow-studies;
now glittering and jeering with concealed
rottenness as in Aubrey Beardsley's
best manner, now hinting terrors behind the
commonest shapes and objects as in the
subtler and less obvious work of Gustave
Doré.  He would often regard it as merciful
that most persons of high intelligence jeer
at the inmost mysteries; for, he argued, if
superior minds were ever placed in fullest
contact with the secrets preserved by ancient
and lowly cults, the resultant abnormalities
would soon not only wreck the world,
but threaten the very integrity of the
universe.  All this reflection was no doubt
morbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of
humor ably offset it.  Malone was satisfied to
let his notions remain as half-spied and
forbidden visions to be lightly played with;
and hysteria came only when duty flung him
into a hell of revelation too sudden and
insidious to escape.
</p>
<p>
He had for some time been detailed to
the Butler Street station in Brooklyn when
the Red Hook matter came to his notice.
Red Hook is a maze of hybrid squalor near
the ancient waterfront opposite Governor's
Island, with dirty highways climbing the
hill from the wharves to that higher ground
where the decayed lengths of Clinton and
Court Streets lead off toward the Borough
Hall.  Its houses are mostly of brick, dating
from the first quarter of the middle of the
nineteenth century, and some of the
obscurer alleys and byways have that alluring
antique flavor which conventional reading
leads us to call "Dickensian."  The population
is a hopeless tangle and enigma; Syrian,
Spanish, Italian, and Negro elements
impinging upon one another, and fragments of
Scandinavian and American belts lying not
far distant.  It is a babel of sound and filth,
and sends out strange cries to answer the
lapping of oily waves at its grimy piers and
the monstrous organ litanies of the harbor
whistles.  Here long ago a brighter picture
dwelt, with clear-eyed mariners on the lower
streets and homes of taste and substance
where the larger houses line the hill.  One
can trace the relics of this former happiness
in the trim shapes of the buildings, the
occasional graceful churches and the evidences
of original art and background in bits of
detail here and there—a worn flight of steps,
a battered doorway, a wormy pair of decorative
columns or pilasters, or a fragment of
once green space with bent and rusted iron
railing.  The houses are generally in solid
blocks, and now and then a many-windowed
cupola arises to tell of days when the
households of captains and ship-owners watched
the sea.
</p>
<p>
From this tangle of material and spiritual
putrescence the blasphemies of an hundred
dialects assail the sky.  Hordes of prowlers
reel shouting and singing along the lanes
and thoroughfares, occasional furtive hands
suddenly extinguish lights and pull down
curtains, and swarthy, sin-pitted faces
disappear from windows when visitors pick their
way through.  Policemen despair of order
or reform, and seek rather to erect barriers
protecting the outside world from the contagion.
</p>
<p>
The clang of the patrol is answered
by a kind of spectral silence, and such
prisoners as are taken are never communicative.
Visible offenses are as varied as the
local dialects, and run the gamut from
the smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens
through diverse stages of lawlessness and
obscure vice to murder and mutilation in
their most abhorrent guises.  That these
visible affairs are not more frequent is not
to the neighborhood's credit, unless the
power of concealment be an art demanding
credit.  More people enter Red Hook than
leave it—or at least, than leave it by the
landward side—and those who are not
loquacious are the likeliest to leave.
</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>
Malone found in this state of things
a faint stench of secrets more terrible
than any of the sins denounced by citizens
and bemoaned by priest and philanthropists.
He was conscious, as one who united
imagination with scientific knowledge, that
modern people under lawless conditions
tend uncannily to repeat the darkest
instinctive patterns of primitive half-ape
savagery in their daily life and ritual
observances; and he had often viewed with
an anthropologist's shudder the chanting,
cursing processions of blear-eyed and
pock-marked young men which wound their way
along in the dark small hours of morning.
One saw groups of these youths incessantly;
sometimes in leering vigils on street corners,
sometimes in doorways playing eerily on
cheap instruments of music, sometimes in
stupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around
cafeteria tables near Borough Hall, and
sometimes in whispering converse around
dingy taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops
of crumbling and closely shuttered old
houses.  They chilled and fascinated him
more than he dared confess to his associates
on the force, for he seemed to see in them
some monstrous thread of secret continuity;
some fiendish, cryptical and ancient pattern
utterly beyond and below the sordid mass
of facts and habits and haunts listed with
such conscientious technical care by the
police.  They must be, he felt inwardly, the
heirs of some shocking and primordial
tradition; the sharers of debased and broken
scraps from cults and ceremonies older than
mankind.  Their coherence and definiteness
suggested it, and it showed in the singular
suspicion of order which lurked beneath
their squalid disorder.  He had not read in
vain such treatises as Miss Murray's Witch
Cult in Western Europe; and knew that up
to recent years there had certainly survived
among peasants and furtive folk a frightful
and clandestine system of assemblies and
orgies descended from dark religions
antedating the Aryan World, and appearing in
popular legends as Black Masses and
Witches' Sabbaths.  That these hellish
vestiges of old Turanian-Asiatic magic and
fertility-cults were even now wholly dead
he could not for a moment suppose, and
he frequently wondered how much older
and how much blacker than the very worst
of the muttered tales some of them might
really be.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<h3>
III
</h3>
<p>
It was the case of Robert Suydam which
took Malone to the heart of things in
Red Hook.  Suydam was a lettered recluse
of ancient Dutch family, possessed
originally of barely independent means, and
inhabiting the spacious but ill-preserved
mansion which his grandfather had built
in Flatbush when that village was little
more then a pleasant group of Colonial
cottages surrounding the steepled and
ivy-clad Reformed Church with its iron-railed
yard of Netherlandish gravestones.  In this
lonely house, set back from Martense Street
amidst a yard of venerable trees, Suydam
had read and brooded for some six decades
except for a period a generation before,
when he had sailed for the Old World
and remained there out of sight for eight
years.  He could afford no servants, and
would admit but few visitors to his absolute
solitude; eschewing close friendships and
receiving his rare acquaintances in one of
the three ground-floor rooms, which he kept
in order—a vast, high-ceiled library whose
walls were solidly packed with tattered
books of ponderous, archaic, and vaguely
repellent aspect.  The growth of the town
and its final absorption in the Brooklyn
district had meant nothing to Suydam, and
he had come to mean less and less to the
town.  Elderly people still pointed him out
on the streets, but to most of the recent
population he was merely a queer, corpulent
old fellow whose unkempt white hair,
stubbly beard, shiny black clothes and
gold-headed cane earned him an amused glance
and nothing more.  Malone did not know
him by sight till duty called him to the
case, but had heard of him indirectly as a
really profound authority on medieval
superstition, and had once idly meant to look
up an out-of-print pamphlet of his on the
Kabbalah and the Faustus legend, which a
friend had quoted from memory.
</p>
<p>
Suydam became a "case" when his distant
and only relatives sought court pronouncements
on his sanity.  Their action seemed
sudden to the outside world, but was really
undertaken only after prolonged observation
and sorrowful debate.  It was based on
certain odd changes in his speech and habits;
wild references to impending wonders, and
unaccountable hauntings of disreputable
Brooklyn neighborhoods.  He had been
growing shabbier and shabbier with the
years, and now prowled about like a
veritable mendicant; seen occasionally by
humiliated friends in subway stations, or
loitering on the benches around Borough Hall
in conversation with groups of swarthy,
evil-looking strangers.  When he spoke it was
to babble of unlimited powers almost within
his grasp, and to repeat with knowing
leers such mystical words of names as
"Sephiroth," "Ashmodai" and "Samael."  The
court action revealed that he was using
up his income and wasting his principal
in the purchase of curious tomes imported
from London and Paris, and in the
maintenance of a squalid basement flat in the
Red Hook district where he spent nearly
every night, receiving odd delegations of
mixed rowdies and foreigners, and apparently
conducting some kind of ceremonial
service behind the green blinds of secretive
windows.  Detectives assigned to follow him
reported strange cries and chants and
prancing of feet filtering out from these
nocturnal rites, and shuddered at their peculiar
ecstasy and abandon despite the commonness
of weird orgies in that sodden section.
When, however, the matter came to a
hearing, Suydam managed to preserve his
liberty.  Before the judge his manner grew
urbane and reasonable, and he freely
admitted the queerness of demeanor and
extravagant cast of language into which he
had fallen through excessive devotion to
study and research.  He was, he said,
engaged in the investigation of certain details
of European tradition which required the
closest contact with foreign groups and
their songs and folk dances.  The notion
that any low secret society was preying
upon him, as hinted by his relatives, was
obviously absurd; and showed how sadly
limited was their understanding of him and
his work.  Triumphing with his calm
explanations, he was suffered to depart
unhindered; and the paid detectives of the
Suydams, Corlears and Van Brunts were
withdrawn in resigned disgust.
</p>
<p>
It was here that an alliance of Federal
inspectors and police, Malone with them,
entered the case.  The law had watched the
Suydam action with interest, and had in
many instances been called upon to aid the
private detectives.  In this work it developed
that Suydam's new associates were among
the blackest and most vicious criminals of
Red Hook's devious lanes, and that at least
a third of them were known and repeated
offenders in the matter of thievery, disorder,
and the importation of illegal immigrants.
Indeed, it would not have been too much
to say that the old scholar's particular circle
coincided almost perfectly with the worst of
the organized cliques which smuggled ashore
certain nameless and unclassified Asian
dregs wisely turned back by Ellis Island.  In
the teeming rookeries of Parker Place—since
renamed—where Suydam had his
basement flat, there had grown up a very
unusual colony of unclassified slant-eyed
folk who used the Arabic alphabet but
were eloquently repudiated by the great
mass of Syrians in and around Atlantic
Avenue.  They could all have been deported
for lack of credentials, but legalism is
slow-moving, and one does not disturb Red Hook
unless publicity forces one to.
</p>
<p>
These creatures attended a tumbledown
stone church, used Wednesdays as a dance
hall, which reared its Gothic buttresses
near the vilest part of the waterfront.
Clergy throughout Brooklyn denied the
place all standing and authenticity, and
policemen agreed with them when they
listened to the noises it emitted at night.
Malone used to fancy he heard terrible
cracked bass notes from a hidden organ
far underground when the church stood
empty and unlighted, whilst all observers
dreaded the shrieking and drumming which
accompanied the visible services.  Suydam,
when questioned, said he thought the ritual
was some remnant of Nestorian Christianity
tinctured with the Shamanism of Tibet.
Most of the people, he conjectured, were
of Mongoloid stock, originating somewhere
in or near Kurdistan—and Malone could
not help recalling that Kurdistan is the land
of the Yezidees, last survivors of the Persian
devil-worshippers.  However this may have
been, the stir of the Suydam investigation
made it certain that these unauthorized
newcomers were flooding Red Hook in
increasing numbers; entering through some
marine conspiracy unreached by revenue
officers and harbor police, overrunning
Parker Place and rapidly spreading up the
hill, and welcomed with curious fraternalism
by the other assorted denizens of the region.
Their squat figures and characteristic
squinting physiognomies grotesquely combined
with flashy American clothing, appeared
more and more numerously among the
loafers and nomad gangsters of the Borough
Hall section; till at length it was deemed
necessary to compute their number, ascertain
their sources and occupations, and find if
possible a way to round them up and deliver
them to the proper immigration authorities.
To this task Malone was assigned by agreement
of Federal and city forces, and as he
commenced his canvass of Red Hook he felt
poised upon the brink of nameless terrors,
with the shabby, unkempt figure of Robert
Suydam as archfiend and adversary.

<p>
Police methods are varied and ingenious.
Malone, through unostentatious
rambles, carefully casual conversations,
well-timed offers of hip-pocket liquor, and
judicious dialogues with frightened prisoners,
learned many isolated facts about the
movement whose aspect had become so
menacing.  The newcomers were indeed Kurds,
but of a dialect obscure and puzzling to
exact philology.  Such of them as worked
lived mostly as dock-hands and unlicensed
peddlers, though frequently serving in
Greek restaurants and tending corner
newsstands.  Most of them, however, had no
visible means of support; and were
obviously connected with underworld pursuits,
of which smuggling and bootlegging were
the least indescribable.  They had come in
steamships, apparently tramp freighters, and
had been unloaded by stealth on moonless
nights in rowboats which stole under a
certain wharf and followed a hidden canal
and house Malone could not locate, for the
memories of his informants were exceedingly
confused, while their speech was to a
great extent beyond even the ablest
interpreters; nor could he gain any real data on
the reasons for their systematic importation.
They were reticent about the exact spot from
which they had come, and were never
sufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies
which had sought them out and directed
their course.  Indeed, they developed
something like acute fright when asked the
reason for their presence.  Gangsters of other
breeds were equally taciturn, and the most
that could be gathered was that some god
or great priesthood had promised them
unheard-of powers and supernatural glories
and rulerships in a strange land.
</p>
<p>
The attendance of both newcomers and
old gangsters at Suydam's closely guarded
nocturnal meetings was very regular, and
the police soon learned that the erstwhile
recluse had leased additional flats to
accommodate such guests as knew his password;
at last occupying three entire houses and
permanently harboring many of his queer
companions.  He spent but little time now
at his Flatbush home, apparently going
and coming only to obtain and return books;
and his face and manner had attained an
appalling pitch of wildness.  Malone twice
interviewed him, but was each time bruskly
repulsed.  He knew nothing, he said, of any
mysterious plots or movements; and had no
idea how the Kurds could have entered or
what they wanted.  His business was to
study undisturbed the folk-lore of all the
immigrants of the district; a business with
which policemen had no legitimate concern.
Malone mentioned his admiration for
Suydam's old brochure on the Kabbalah and
other myths, but the old man's softening
was only momentary.  He sensed an intrusion,
and rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain
way; till Malone withdrew disgusted,
and turned to other channels of information.
</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>
What Malone would have unearthed
could he have worked continuously on
the case, we shall never know.  As it was, a
stupid conflict between city and Federal
authority suspended the investigation for
several months, during which the detective was
busy with other assignments.  But at no time
did he lose interest, or fail to stand amazed
at what began to happen to Robert Suydam.
Just at the time when a wave of kidnappings
and disappearances spread its excitement over
New York, the unkempt scholar embarked
upon a metamorphosis as startling as it was
absurd.  One day he was seen near Borough
Hall with clean-shaved face, well-trimmed
hair, and tastefully immaculate attire, and
on every day thereafter some obscure
improvement was noticed in him.  He
maintained his new fastidiousness without
interruption, added to it an unwonted sparkle
of eye and crispness of speech, and began
little by little to shed the corpulence which
had so long deformed him.  Now frequently
taken for less than his age, he acquired an
elasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanor
to match the new tradition, and showed a
curious darkening of the hair which
somehow did not suggest dye.  As the months
passed, he commenced to dress less and less
conservatively, and finally astonished his
few friends by renovating and redecorating
his Flatbush mansion, which he threw open
in a series of receptions, summoning all the
acquaintances he could remember, and
extending a special welcome to the fully
forgiven relatives who had lately sought his
restraint.  Some attended through curiosity,
others through duty; but all were suddenly
charmed by the dawning grace and urbanity
of the former hermit.  He had, he asserted,
accomplished most of his allotted work; and
having just inherited some property from a
half-forgotten European friend, was about
to spend his remaining years in a brighter
second youth which ease, care and diet had
made possible to him.  Less and less was he
seen at Red Hook, and more and more did
he move in the society to which he was born.
Policemen noted a tendency of the gangsters
to congregate at the old stone church and
dancehall instead of at the basement flat in
Parker Place, though the latter and its recent
annexes still overflowed with noxious life.
</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>
Then two incidents occurred—wide
enough apart, but both of intense interest
in the case as Malone envisaged it.  One
was a quiet announcement in the <i>Eagle</i> of
Robert Suydam's engagement to Miss
Cornelia Gerritsen of Bayside, a young woman
of excellent position, and distantly related
to the elderly bridegroom-elect; whilst the
other was a raid on the dance-hall church
by city police, after a report that the face of
a kidnapped child had been seen for a
second at one of the basement windows.
Malone had participated in this raid, and
studied the place with much care when
inside.  Nothing was found—in fact, the
building was entirely deserted when visited—but
the sensitive Celt was vaguely disturbed by
many things about the interior.  There were
crudely painted panels he did not like—panels
which depicted sacred faces with
peculiarly worldly and sardonic expressions,
and which occasionally took liberties that
even a layman's sense of decorum could
scarcely countenance.  Then, too, he did not
relish the Greek inscription on the wall
above the pulpit; an ancient incantation
which he had once stumbled upon in Dublin
college days, and which read, literally
translated: "O friend and companion of night,
thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and
spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of
shades among the tombs; who longest for
blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorge,
Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look favorably
on our sacrifices!"
</p>
<p>
When he read this he shuddered, and
thought vaguely of the cracked bass
organ-notes he fancied he had heard beneath the
church on certain nights.  He shuddered
again at the rust around the rim of a metal
basin which stood on the altar, and paused
nervously when his nostrils seemed to detect
a curious and ghastly stench from somewhere
in the neighborhood.  That organ memory
haunted him, and he explored the basement
with particular assiduity before he left.  The
place was very hateful to him; yet after all,
were the blasphemous panels and inscriptions
more than mere crudities perpetrated
by the ignorant?
</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>
By the time of Suydam's wedding the
kidnapping epidemic had become a
popular newspaper scandal.  Most of the
victims were young children of the lowest
classes, but the increasing number of
disappearances had worked up a sentiment of the
strongest fury.  Journals clamored for action
from the police, and once more the Butler
Street station sent its men over Red Hook
for clues, discoveries, and criminals.  Malone
was glad to be on the trail again, and took
pride in a raid on one of Suydam's Parker
Place houses.  There, indeed, no stolen child
was found, despite the tales of screams and
the red sash picked up in the areaway; but
the paintings and rough inscriptions on the
peeling walls of most of the rooms, and the
primitive chemical laboratory in the attic,
all helped to convince the detective that he
was on the track of something tremendous.
The paintings were appalling—hideous
monsters of every shape and size, and parodies
on human outlines which cannot be
described.  The writing was in red, and varied
from Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew
letters.  Malone could not read much of it,
but what he did decipher was portentous
and cabalistic enough.  One frequently
repeated motto was in a sort of Hebraized
Hellenistic Greek, and suggested the most
terrible demon-evocations of the
Alexandrian decadence:
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
HEL.  HELOYM.  SOTHER.  EMMANVEL.
SABOATH.  AGLA.  TETRAGRAMMATION.
AGYROS.  OTHEOS.  ISCHYROS.
ATHANATOS.  IEHOVA.  VA.
ADONAL.  SADY.  HOMOVSION.
MESSIAS.  ESCHEREHEYE.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Circles and pentagrams loomed on every
hand, and told indubitably of the strange
beliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt
so squalidly here.  In the cellar, however, the
strangest thing was found—a pile of
genuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a
piece of burlap, and bearing upon their
shining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics
which also adorned the walls.  During this
raid the police encountered only a passive
resistance from the squinting Orientals that
swarmed from every door.  Finding nothing
relevant, they had to leave all as it was; but
the precinct captain wrote Suydam a note,
advising him to look closely to the character
of his tenants, and protegés in view of the
growing public clamor.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<h3>

</h3>
<p>
Then came the June wedding and the
great sensation; Flatbush was gay for the
hour about high noon, and pennanted
motors thronged the street near the old
Dutch church where an awning stretched
from door to highway.  No local event ever
surpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen nuptials in
tone and scale, and the party which escorted
the bride and groom to the Cunard pier
was, if not exactly the smartest, at least a
solid page from the Social Register!  At 5
o'clock adieux was waved, and the ponderous
liner edged away from the long pier,
slowly turned its nose seaward, discarded
its tug, and headed for widening water
spaces that led to Old World wonders.  By
night the outer harbor was cleared, and late
passengers watched the stars twinkling
above an unpolluted ocean.
</p>
<p>
Whether the tramp steamer or the scream
was first to gain attention, no one can say.
Probably they were simultaneous, but it is
of no use to calculate.  The scream came
from the Suydam stateroom, and the sailor
who broke down the door could perhaps
have told frightful things if he had not
forthwith gone completely mad—as it is, he
shrieked more loudly than the first victims,
and thereafter ran simpering about the
vessel till caught and put in irons.  The ship's
doctor who entered the stateroom and
turned on the lights a moment later did not
go mad, but told nobody what he saw till
afterward, when he corresponded with
Malone in Chepachet.  It was murder—strangulation—but
one need not say that the claw-mark
on Mrs. Suydam's throat could not
have come from her husband's or any other
human hand, or that upon the white wall
there flickered for an instant in hateful red
a legend which, later copied from memory,
seems to have been nothing less than the
fearsome Chaldee letters of the word
"LILITH."  One need not mention these
things because they vanished so quickly—as
for Suydam, one could at least bar others
from the room until one knew what to think
oneself.  The doctor has distinctly assured
Malone that he did not see IT.  The open
porthole, just before he turned on the lights,
was clouded for a second with a certain
phosphorescence, and for a moment there
seemed to echo in the night outside the
suggestion of a faint and hellish tittering; but
no real outline met the eye.  As proof, the
doctor points to his continued sanity.
</p>
<p>
Then the tramp steamer claimed all attention.
A boat put off, and a horde of swart,
insolent ruffians in officers' dress swarmed
aboard the temporarily halted Cunarder.
They wanted Suydam or his body—they had
known of his trip, and for certain reasons
were sure he would die.  The captain's deck
was almost a pandemonium; for at the
instant, between the doctor's report from the
stateroom and the demands of the men from
the tramp, not even the wisest and gravest
seaman could think what to do.  Suddenly
the leader of the visiting mariners, an Arab
with a hatefully negroid mouth, pulled forth
a dirty, crumpled paper and handed it to the
captain.  It was signed by Robert Suydam,
and bore the following odd message:
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
<i>In case of sudden or unexpected accident
or death on my part, please deliver me or
my body unquestioningly into the hands of
the bearer and his associates.  Everything, for
me, and perhaps for you, depends on absolute
compliance.  Explanations can come
later—do not fail me now.</i>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Robert Suydam.</i>
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Captain and doctor looked at each
other, and the latter whispered something
to the former.  Finally they nodded
rather helplessly and led the way to the
Suydam stateroom.  The doctor directed the
captain's glance away as he unlocked the
door and admitted the strange seamen, nor
did he breathe easily, till they filed out with
their burden after an unaccountably long
period of preparation.  It was wrapped in
bedding from the berths, and the doctor was
glad that the outlines were not very
revealing.  Somehow the men got the thing over
the side and away to their tramp steamer
without uncovering it.
</p>
<p>
The Cunarder started again, and the
doctor and ship's undertaker sought out the
Suydam stateroom to perform what last
services they could.  Once more the physician
was forced to reticence and even to mendacity,
for a hellish thing had happened.
When the undertaker asked him why he had
drained off all of Mrs. Suydam's blood, he
neglected to affirm that he had not done so;
nor did he point to the vacant bottle-spaces
on the rack, or to the odor in the sink which
showed the hasty disposition of the bottles'
original contents.  The pockets of those
men—if men they were—had bulged damnably
when they left the ship.  Two hours later,
and the world knew by radio all that it
ought to know of the horrible affair.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<h3>
VI
</h3>
<p>
That same June evening, without having
heard a word from the sea, Malone was
very busy among the alleys of Red Hook.
A sudden stir seemed to permeate the place,
and as if apprized by "grapevine telegraph"
of something singular, the denizens
clustered expectantly around the dance-hall
church and the houses in Parker Place.
Three children had just disappeared—blue-eyed
Norwegians from the streets toward
Gowanus—and there were rumors of a mob
forming among the sturdy Viking of that
section.  Malone had for weeks been urging
his colleagues to attempt a general clean-up;
and at last, moved by conditions more obvious
to their common sense than the conjectures
of a Dublin dreamer, they had agreed
upon a final stroke.  The unrest and menace
of this evening had been the deciding
factor, and just about midnight a raiding party
recruited from three stations descended
upon Parker Place and its environs.  Doors
were battered in, stragglers arrested, and
candle-lighted rooms forced to disgorge
unbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in
figured robes, miters and other inexplicable
devices.  Much was lost in the mêlée for
objects were thrown hastily down unexpected
shafts, and betraying odors deadened by the
sudden kindling of pungent incense.  But
spattered blood was everywhere, and
Malone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier
or altar from which the smoke was still
rising.
</p>
<p>
He wanted to be in several places at once,
and decided on Suydam's basement flat only
after a messenger had reported the complete
emptiness of the dilapidated dance-hall
church.  The flat, he thought, must hold
some clue to a cult of which the occult
scholar had so obviously become the center
and leader; and it was with real expectancy
that he ransacked the musty rooms, noted
their vaguely charnal odor, and examined
the curious books, instruments, gold ingots,
and glass-stoppered bottles scattered
carelessly here and there.  Once a lean,
black-and-white cat edged between his feet and
tripped him, overturning at the same time a
beaker half full of red liquid.  The shock
was severe, and to this day Malone is not
certain of what he saw; but in dreams he
still pictures that cat as it scuttled away with
certain monstrous alterations and peculiarities.
</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>
Then came the locked cellar door, and
the search for something to break it
down.  A heavy stool stood near, and its
tough seat was more than enough for the
antique panels.  A crack formed and
enlarged, and the whole door gave way—but
from the other side; whence poured a howling
tumult of ice-cold wind with all the stenches
of the bottomless pit, and whence
reached a sucking force not of earth or
heaven, which, coiling sentiently about the
paralyzed detective, dragged him through
the aperture and down unmeasured spaces
filled with whispers and wails, and gusts of
mocking laughter.
</p>
<p>
Of course it was a dream.  All the specialists
have told him so, and he has nothing
tangible to prove the contrary.  Indeed, he
would rather have it thus; for then the sight
of old brick slums and dark foreign faces
would not eat so deeply into his soul.  But at
the time it was all horribly real, and nothing
can ever efface the memory of those nighted
crypts, those titan arcades, and those
half-formed shapes of hell that strode
gigantically in silence holding half-eaten things
whose still surviving portions screamed for
mercy or laughed with madness.  Odors of
incense and corruption joined in sickening
concert, and the black air was alive with the
cloudy, semi-visible bulk of shapeless
elemental things with eyes.  Somewhere dark
sticky water was lapping at onyx piers, and
once the shivery tinkle of raucous little bells
pealed out to greet the insane titter of a
naked phosphorescent thing which swam
into sight, scrambled ashore, and climbed
up to squat leeringly on a carved golden
pedestal in the black ground.
</p>
<p>
Avenues of limitless night seemed to radiate
in every direction, till one might fancy
that here lay the root of a contagion destined
to sicken and swallow cities, and engulf
nations in the fetor of hybrid pestilence.
Here cosmic sin had entered, and festered
by unhallowed rites had commenced the
grinning march of death that was to rot us
all to fungus abnormalities too hideous for
the grave's holding.  Satan here held his
Babylonish court, and in the blood of
stainless childhood the leprous limbs of
phosphorescent Lilith were laved.  Incubi and
succubae howled praise to Hecate, and
headless mooncalves bleated to the Magna
Mater.  Goats leaped to the sound of thin
accursed flutes, and AEgipans chased
endlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks
twisted like swollen toads.  Moloch and
Ashtaroth were not absent; for in this
quintessence of all damnation the bounds of
consciousness were let down, and man's fancy
lay open to vistas of every realm of horror
and every forbidden dimension that evil had
power to mold.  The world and nature were
helpless against such assaults from unsealed
wells of night, nor could any sign or prayer
check the Walpurgissage of horror which
had come when a sage with the hateful
locked and brimming coffer of transmitted
demon-lore.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly a ray of physical light shot
through these fantasms, and Malone heard
the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of
things that should be dead.  A boat with a
lantern in its prow darted into sight, made
fast to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier,
and vomited forth several dark men bearing
a long burden swathed in bedding.  They
took it to the naked phosphorescent thing
on the carved gold pedestal, and the thing
tittered and pawed the bedding.  Then they
unswathed it, and propped upright before
the pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a
corpulent old man with stubby beard and
unkempt white hair.  The phosphorescent
thing tittered again, and the men produced
bottles from their pockets and anointed its
feet with red, whilst they afterward gave
the bottles to the thing to drink from.
</p>
<p>
All at once, from an arcaded avenue leading
endlessly away, there came the demoniac
rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ,
choking and rumbling out of the mockeries
of hell in cracked, sardonic bass.  In an
instant every moving entity was electrified;
and forming at once into a ceremonial
procession, the nightmare horde slithered away
in quiet of the sound—goat, satyr, and
AEgipan, incubus, succuba, and lemur,
twisted toad and shapeless elemental,
dog-faced howler and silent strutter in
darkness—all led by the abominable naked
phosphorescent thing that had squatted on
the carved golden throne; and that now
strode insolently bearing in its arms the
glassy-eyed corpse of the corpulent old
man.  The strange dark man danced in the
rear, and the whole column skipped and
leaped with Dionysiac fury.  Malone
staggered after them a few steps, delirious
and hazy, and doubtful of his place in
this or any world.  Then he turned, faltered,
and sank down on the cold damp stone,
gasping and shivering as the demon organ
croaked on, and the howling and drumming
and tinkling of the mad procession grew
fainter and fainter.
</p>
<p>
Vaguely he was conscious of chanted
horrors, and shocking croakings afar off.
Now and then a wail or whine of ceremonial
devotion would float to him through
the black arcade, whilst eventually there
rose the dreadful Greek incantation whose
text he had read above the pulpit of that
dance-hall church.
</p>
<p>
"O friend and companion of night thou
who rejoicest in the baying of dogs (here
a hideous howl burst forth) and spilt
blood (here nameless sounds vied with
morbid shriekings), who wanderest in the
midst of shades among the tombs (here
a whistling sigh occurred), who longest
for blood and bringest terror to mortals
(short, sharp cries from myriad throats),
Gorgo (repeated as response), Mormo
(repeated with ecstasy), thousand-faced
moon (sighs and flute notes), look
favorably on our sacrifices!"
</p>
<p>
As the chant closed, a general shout
went up, and hissing sounds nearly drowned
the croaking of the cracked bass organ.
Then a gasp as from many throats, and
a babel of barked and bleated words—"Lilith,
Great Lilith, behold the Bridegroom!"  More
cries, a clamor of rioting,
and the sharp, clicking footfalls of a
running figure.  The footfalls approached, and
Malone raised himself to his elbow to look.
</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>
The luminosity of the crypt, lately
diminished, had now slightly increased;
and in that devil-light there appeared the
fleeing form of that which should not
flee or feel or breathe—the glassy-eyed,
gangrenous corpse of the corpulent old
man, now needing no support, but animated
by some infernal sorcery of the rite just
closed.  After it raced the naked, tittering,
phosphorescent thing that belonged on the
carven pedestal, and still farther behind
panted the dark men, and all the dread crew
of sentient loathsomenesses.  The corpse
was gaining on its pursuers, and seemed
bent on a definite object, straining with
every rotting muscle toward the carved
golden pedestal, whose necromantic
importance was evidently so great.  Another
moment and it had reached its goal, whilst
the trailing throng labored on with more
frantic speed.  But they were too late, for
in one final spurt of strength which ripped
tendon from tendon and sent its noisome
bulk floundering to the floor in a state of
jellyish dissolution, the staring corpse which
had been Robert Suydam achieved its
object and its triumph.  The push had been
tremendous, but the force had held out;
and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy
blotch of corruption the pedestal he had
pushed tottered, tipped, and finally careened
from its onyx base into the thick waters
below, sending up a parting gleam of carven
gold as it sank heavily to undreamable
gulfs of lower Tartarus.  In that instant,
too, the whole scene of horror faded to
nothingness before Malone's eyes; and he
fainted amidst a thunderous crash which
seemed to blot out all the evil universe.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<h3>
VII
</h3>
<p>
Malone's dream, experienced in full
before he knew of Suydam's death and
transfer at sea, was curiously supplemented
by some oddities of the case; though that
is no reason why anyone should believe it.
The three old houses in Parker Place,
doubtless long rotten with decay in its most
insidious form, collapsed without visible
cause while half the raiders and most of
the prisoners were inside; and both of the
greater number were instantly killed.  Only
in the basements and cellars was there
much saving of life, and Malone was lucky
to have been deep below the house of
Robert Suydam.  For he really was there,
as no one is disposed to deny.  They found
him unconscious by the edge of the
night-black pool, with a grotesquely horrible
jumble of decay and bone, identifiable
through dental work as the body of Suydam,
a few feet away.  The case was plain, for
it was hither that the smugglers'
underground canal led; and the men who took
Suydam from the ship had brought him
home.  They themselves were never found,
or identified; and the ship's doctor is not yet
satisfied with the certitudes of the police.
</p>
<p>
Suydam was evidently a leader in
extensive man-smuggling operations, for the
canal to his house was but one of several
subterranean channels and tunnels in the
neighborhood.  There was a tunnel from
this house to a crypt beneath the
dance-hall church; a crypt accessible from the
church only through a narrow secret passage
in the north wall, and in whose chambers
some singular and terrible things were
discovered.  The croaking organ was there,
as well as a vast arched chapel with wooden
benches and a strangely figured altar.  The
walls were lined with small cells, in
seventeen of which—hideous to relate—solitary
prisoners in a state of complete idiocy
were found chained, including four mothers
with infants of disturbingly strange
appearance.  These infants died soon after
exposure to the light; a circumstance which
the doctors thought rather merciful.  Nobody
but Malone, among those who inspected
them, remembered the somber question of
old Delrio: "An sint unquan daemones
incubi et succubae, et an ex tali, congressu
proles nasci queat?"
</p>
<p>
Before the canals were filled up they
were thoroughly dredged, and yielded
forth a sensational array of sawed and split
bones of all sizes.  The kidnapping epidemic,
very clearly, had been traced home; though
only two of the surviving prisoners could
by any legal thread be connected with it.
These men are now in prison, since they
failed of conviction as accessories in the
actual murders.  The carved golden pedestal
or throne so often mentioned by Malone
as of primary occult importance was never
brought to light, though at one place under
the Suydam house the canal, was observed
to sink into a well too deep for dredging.
It was choked up at the mouth and cemented
over when the cellars of the new houses
were made, but Malone often speculates
on what lied beneath.  The police, satisfied
that they had shattered a dangerous gang
of maniacs and alien smugglers, turned over
to the Federal authorities the unconvicted
Kurds, who before their deportation were
conclusively found to belong to the Yezidee
clan of devils-worshippers.  The tramp ship
and its crew remain an elusive mystery,
though cynical detectives are once more
ready to combat its smuggling and
rum-running ventures.  Malone thinks these
detectives show a sadly limited perspective
in their lack of wonder at the myriad
unexplainable details, and the suggestive
obscurity of the whole case; though he is
just as critical of the newspapers, which
saw only a morbid sensation and gloated
over a minor sadist cult when they might
have proclaimed a horror from the
universe's very heart.  But he is content to rest
silent in Chepachet, calming his nervous
system and praying that time may gradually
transfer his terrible experience from the
realm of present reality to that of
picturesque and semi-mythical remoteness.
</p>
<p>
Robert Suydam sleeps beside his bride
in Greenwood Cemetery.  No funeral was
held over the strangely released bones,
and relatives are grateful for the swift
oblivion which overtook the case as a
whole.
</p>
<p>
The scholar's connection with the Red
Hook horrors, indeed, was never emblazoned
by legal proof; since his death forestalled the
inquiry he would otherwise have faced.
His own end is not much mentioned, and
the Suydams hope that posterity may recall
him only as a gentle recluse who dabbled
in harmless magic and folk-lore.
</p>
<p>
As for Red Hook—it is always the
same.  Suydam came and went; a terror
gathered and faded; but the evil spirit of
darkness and squalor broods on amongst
the mongrels in the old brick houses; and
prowling bands still parade on unknown
errands past windows where lights and
twisted faces unaccountably appear and
disappear.  Age-old horror is a hydra with a
thousand heads, and the cults of darkness
are rooted in blasphemies deeper than the
well of Democritus.  The soul of the beast
is omnipresent and triumphant, and Red
Hook's legions of blear-eyed, pockmarked
youths still chant and curse and howl
as they file from abyss to abyss, none knows
whence or whither, pushed on by blind
laws of biology which they may never
understand.  As of old more people enter
Red Hook than leave it on the landward
side, and there are already rumors of new

The dance-hall church is now mostly a
dance-hall, and queer faces have appeared
at night at the windows.  Lately a policeman
expressed the belief that the filled-up
crypt has been dug out again, and for no
simply explainable purpose.  Who are we
to combat poisons older than history and
mankind?  Apes danced in Asia to those
horrors, and the cancer lurks secure and
spreading where furtiveness hides in rows
of decaying brick.

Malone does not shudder without cause—for
only the other day an officer overheard
a swarthy squinting hag teaching a small
child some whispering patois in the shadow
of an areaway.  He listened, and thought
it very strange when he heard her repeat
over and over again:
</p>
<p>
"O friend and companion of night thou
who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and
spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst
of shades among the tombs, who longest
for blood and bringest terror to mortals,
Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look
favorably on our sacrifices!"

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
