# elevenlabs-hackathon-warsaw

The primary goal of this project is to push the boundaries of interactive storytelling and offer users a truly unique experience. Introducing our first narration-extended storytelling game.

# Objective

Using Large Language Model (LLM) agents in conjunction with the ElevenLabs platform, we are developing a dynamic, voice-guided storytelling experience. This approach enables players to immerse themselves in the narrative, make impactful decisions, and shape the storyâ€”free from rigid, predetermined scripts. Additionally, the application monitors inference speed, providing valuable data for model benchmarking.

# Architecture

This project revolves around a conversational agent programmed to generate creative narratives based on a guiding script:

1. Chat Interface: All interactions take place through a Flask-based chat interface.
2. Decision-Making: The agent follows a core script but prompts the user to make decisions at critical points, thereby influencing the direction of the story.

To create this project we were using:
- Lovable for the front-end
- Mistral as main narration agent
- Elevenlabs for voice acting
- Fal.ai (Flux model) for image generation

# Summary

Designed to run locally by default, this application can also be easily deployed to the cloud. By combining two generative models, it delivers a one-of-a-kind user experience while simultaneously allowing performance benchmarking of these models.
