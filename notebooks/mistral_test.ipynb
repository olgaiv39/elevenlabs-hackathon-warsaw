      "   - **Reblochon**: a savory cheese from the Alps, often used in the dish Tartiflette.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hard Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Comté**: a firm, pressed cheese with a complex flavor profile that includes notes of fruit, nuts, and spices.\n",
      "   - **Beaufort**: a high-quality, firm cheese with a strong, slightly sweet flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Blue Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Roquefort**: a famous blue cheese made from sheep's milk, known for its tangy, salty flavor.\n",
