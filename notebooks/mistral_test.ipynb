      "   - **Camembert de Normandie**: another famous soft cheese, known for its delicate, earthy flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Semi-Soft Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Morbier**: recognizable by its layer of ash in the middle, this cheese has a mild, slightly nutty flavor.\n",
      "   - **Reblochon**: a savory cheese from the Alps, often used in the dish Tartiflette.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hard Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Comté**: a firm, pressed cheese with a complex flavor profile that includes notes of fruit, nuts, and spices.\n",
      "   - **Beaufort**: a high-quality, firm cheese with a strong, slightly sweet flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Blue Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Roquefort**: a famous blue cheese made from sheep's milk, known for its tangy, salty flavor.\n",
      "   - **Bleu d'Auvergne**: a strong, creamy blue cheese from the Auvergne region.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Goat Cheeses**:\n",
      "   - **Chèvre**: a general term for goat cheese, which can vary in texture and flavor, ranging from mild and fresh to strong and aged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these cheeses offers a unique taste experience, and the \"best\" one truly depends on individual preferences. It's always fun to try a variety to discover your personal favorite!\n"
