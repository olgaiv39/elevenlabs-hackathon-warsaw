    "example_1": {"user_input": "I would just run away!", "model_output": "You're running in the fields but you're left with no choice but to enter a dark forest. You immidiately get caught with eternal fear which makes you run even faster. "},
    "example_2": {"user_input": "I would try to shoot it with my shotgun.", "model_output": "Shooting is the best way out. As once someone said. First shoot, then ask questions. You take shotgan and check whether you have shells in it. It took a while to have a confitmation. Now you start aiming at the beast."},
    "example_3": {"user_input": "I will grab keys and start my car.", "model_output": "You're lucky enough to reach it fast. Engin hesitates to start from the very beginning but it starts. 'START' screams in your head and you drive-off. This is the end of the first chapter."},
    "example_4": {"user_input": "I want to investigate the staircase first.", "model_output": "You approach the staircase, running your gloved hand along the polished banister. Halfway up, you notice muddy footprints—fresh ones. The footprints vanish at the top step, as though their owner simply disappeared. What's your decision?"},
    "example_5": {"user_input": "Let me look for secret passages or hidden doors around the top of the stairs.", "model_output": "Pressing gently against the walls, you hear a faint click. A narrow panel slides open, revealing a cramped corridor behind the wall.  A cold draft rushes out, carrying the scent of damp stone. "},
    "example_6": {"user_input": "I want to check behind the crates to see if there’s anything hidden there.", "model_output": "You move slowly toward the stack of crates, each labeled with faded shipping codes. Your footsteps echo in the silence. You pry open the topmost crate and discover dusty ledgers and a hidden envelope marked with a red “X.” Flicking on your flashlight, you glance over the ledgers. They detail shipments to a secret warehouse—dates, times, and large sums of money changing hands. The envelope contains a small Polaroid photo: a blurred figure in a trench coat passing a thick envelope to a tall woman wearing a cloche hat. A sharp creak behind you makes your heart skip. You pivot, flashlight raised. Before you decide your next move, consider: the footprints by the water’s edge weren’t there a moment ago. Someone might be watching."},
    "example_7": {"user_input": "I let the suspect talk before I arrest him—maybe he’s just a pawn", "model_output": "You hold the suspect at gunpoint in the dimly lit warehouse. Rain pounds the roof, and every flicker of lightning reveals fear in his eyes. He spills everything: corruption runs deeper than you ever imagined—judges, politicians, even some of your fellow officers are involved. The suspect whimpers that he only followed orders to protect his family. You handcuff him, but the hollow feeling in your chest lingers. Exposing this conspiracy will take a lifetime of battles. As you watch the squad cars arrive, you realize that even though you’ve solved this case, a darker web remains, tugging at the city’s core. You light a cigarette, the taste of victory turning bitter on your tongue. Crescent Bay’s shadows are vast, and tonight you’ve only parted them a little."},
    "example_8": {"user_input": "I will use the artifact to try and save the forest, no matter the risk.", "model_output": "The carved runes on the ancient stone circle flare with a blinding light as you raise the artifact. The entire forest seems to hold its breath—every creature, every leaf, every branch trembling in anticipation."}
